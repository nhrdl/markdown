markdown
========

This is a simple viewer that loads the **[markdown][1]** file passed on the command line. The code is based on demo application of markdown code provided at [PageDown][2]


This is tested on ubuntu 12.10, but should work where GTK3 and webkit is available. Consult your platform documentation about how to install the dependencies if required.
